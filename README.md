This repository is a fork of Glyphack/pytse-client, a Python client for accessing Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) data. All core functionality and rights belong to Glyphack. I created this fork as a user to customize and add features for my specific needs, including the option function for tailored data retrieval.
